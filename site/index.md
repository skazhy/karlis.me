# Hi, my name is Kārlis.

I type things into computers for fun and profit. I am pretty decent at Clojure and Python. I would like to be better at Haskell and Rust.
I have a [GitHub](https://github.com/skazhy), littered with weekend hacks.

Currently I reside in Rīga, Latvia and write S-expressions for a living.
Among other things, I like [good tunes](https://bandcamp.com/karlis), sci-fi novels, and trail running.

You can reach me at karlis@<span class="light">&lt;address of this page&gt;</span>.

Have a good day!
